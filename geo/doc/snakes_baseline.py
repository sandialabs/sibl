"""This module is a baseline registration and investigation into the output form of the
active contour model (aka snakes) in the scikit-image library.

Reference: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/edges/plot_active_contours.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-edges-plot-active-contours-py

The active contour model is a method to fit open or closed splines to lines or edges in an image 1. It works by minimising an energy that is in part defined by the image and part by the splineâ€™s shape: length and smoothness. The minimization is done implicitly in the shape energy and explicitly in the image energy.

In the following two examples the active contour model is used (1) to segment the face of a person from the rest of an image by fitting a closed curve to the edges of the face and (2) to find the darkest curve between two fixed points while obeying smoothness considerations. Typically it is a good idea to smooth images a bit before analyzing, as done in the following examples.

We initialize a circle around the astronaut's face and use the default boundary condition boundary_condition='periodic' to fit a closed curve. The default parameters w_line=0, w_edge=1 will make the curve search towards edges, such as the boundaries of the face.
