"""This module creates the boundary for the quarter plate Hughes problem.

To run:
# Instead of:
> cd ~/sibl

# it is useful to navigate to the location of the quarter_plate.py file so that the
# output quarter_plate.txt file is written to the same location:
> ~/sibl/geo/doc/dual/lesson_11

> conda activate siblenv
> python quarter_plate.py
