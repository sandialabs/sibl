## Purpose

The Sandia Injury Biomechanics Laboratory analyzes injury due to blast, ballistics, and blunt trauma to help the nation protect the U.S. warfighter. Our contributions to the science of injury causation and prevention aim to significantly reduce the U.S. warfighter's exposure to serious, severe, and fatal injuries.

For more information on the program &mdash; including publications, presentations, and reports &mdash; see our [Sandia National Laboratories website](https://www.sandia.gov/biomechanics/).

## Library

The *SIBL Geometry Engine* is an open-source geometry and mesh engine written in Python and C++ used for 
* BÃ©zier curves, surfaces, and volumes,
* B-spline curves, surfaces, and volumes, and
* Automatic mesh generation of a 2D quadrilateral mesh from a dualized, feature-refined quadtree.

## Documentation

* Learn the formulation and Python implementation from the teaching slides: [pdf download](geo/doc/bezier_b-spline/Hovey_2022_Bezier_B-Spline_SAND2022-7702_C.pdf) (3.3 MB).
* Review the Python library API through the test suite: `~/sibl> pytest -v`
* Automatically create a 2D dualized mesh from a discrete, well-defined boundary. Start here: [Lessons](geo/doc/dual/README.md)
* Use [xyfigure](cli/doc/README.md) and a `.json` configuration file to create high quality LaTeX figures.
* Approximate the angular velocity of a quasi-rigid body using the Three Point Angular Velocity Algorithm ([TPAV](cli/tests/tpav/README.md)).

## Contributing

* [Configure](config/README.md) the development environment.
* Follow the developer [workflow](config/workflow.md).
* To contribute, submit a merge request.
